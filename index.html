        <p>Is it just me or does this meal look more scrumptious because I’m on a diet? Dear diet, things just aren’t looking good for the both of us. It’s not me, it’s you. You’re too much work. You’re boring and I can’t stop cheating on you.It’s not true that money can’t buy happiness. I mean, have you tried buying ice cream? It’s the same thing!</p>
